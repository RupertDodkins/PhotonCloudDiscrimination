This package allows for training and evaluating nets that perform the PCD algorithm.

Photon Cloud Discrimination (PCD) is an algorithm that given a set of photon coordinates in xytw space, applies a label to each photon for the source type (object segementation) and identifies the most likely location of companion sources in the focal plane.
