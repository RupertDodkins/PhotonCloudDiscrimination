Photon Cloud Discrimination (PCD) is an algorithm that given a set of photon x, y, t, w coordinates, labels each photon with the source type (object segementation), and identifies the most likely location of these sources in the focal plane. 

This package allows for training and evaluating nets that perform the PCD algorithm.
